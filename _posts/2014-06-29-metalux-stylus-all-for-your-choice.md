Itâ€™s nothing new about stylus pen, but what we are aiming to do is better design, not to sacrifice the good look to the function. Thus, we chose to place the screen touch device on the opposite of the refill. Animal is totally a new creation and the other two are based on the Habilis and Linellae. Smart, classic and new gel pen, all for your choice!
