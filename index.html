      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <p>JieXi Import&Export, shorted for JC, was found by a bunch of young talents in the pursuit of building their own fortune.</p>

    <section>
      <h1>Why we found the company?</h1>
      <p>The birth place of JC is “the hometown of pen in China”, boasting over 500 pen factories and companies, with annual output of more than 7 billion pieces of pens. On the one hand, the fierce domestic market competition urges these pen factories and companies to go out to sell their products; on the other hand, global sourcing is gaining its popularity. That’s how JC sees the opportunity. </p>

    <section>
      <h1>Where our confidence comes from?</h1>
      <p>Born in this town, JC knows the pen factories and companies and they become JC’s asset. The pen this town produces almost covers anything customers can image. Beside, JC had its own factory------ShuangXing Pen, with over 16 years of manufacturing and sales experience. Its R&D can meet the need of customers who want to open a mold themselves. </p>
